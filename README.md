# upshot suite

Upshot Suite is a Max package comprised of audio effects, event generators, trackers, instruments and many other tools/utilities. Upshot Suite was originally created to open up the Ultomaton environment (https://github.com/benjaminvanesser/ultomaton) and create a more flexible platform for building generative patches.
