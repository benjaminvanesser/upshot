# upshot

Upshot is a Max package comprised of audio effects, event generators, trackers, instruments and many other tools/utilities. Upshot was originally created to open up the Ultomaton platform (https://github.com/benjaminvanesser/ultomaton) and create a more flexible environment for building generative patches.
